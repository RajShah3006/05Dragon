## 👋 Hi, I’m Raj

I’m a BTech Automation Technology Engineering student at McMaster University, passionate about crafting intelligent systems where 3D design, robotics, and software meet. From **Saarthi AI**—an intelligent university guidance counselor—to an OOP-driven **C++ calculator** and sleek **Java/JavaFX prototypes**, I love turning ambitious ideas into polished, working builds.
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D designing, coding and building robots!
